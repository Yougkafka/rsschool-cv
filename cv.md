## My Bio
Most of my experience I have gotten while working in office real estate company. I have come a long way from a recetionist position
to a business center manager, then to real estate department manager of company that holds a chain of business centers and coworking offices.
The latter positiob provider a great number of challenges, which evetually I used for aquiring new skills and knowledge. Dealing with HR, building exploitation, client service and marketing, I was constatnly learning new information, methods, techniques of the mentioned spheres, so that I could excell at what I do. 

At the point where I was managing the development of websites for our company, I realised I stoped googling unfamiliar terms and info, I got in conversations with developers in order to understand the process better, and started just googling how things are done and what is what simply because I was interested.

This interest now has fully grown into a motivation to become a frontend developer, as I started doing HTML Academy exercises and RSschool courses.
